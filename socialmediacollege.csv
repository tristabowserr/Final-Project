1. Power supply: we don't usually have light in my area and even if we have light my charger is faulty, I use to borrow charger most times, so if I have a fixed class am might not be able to participate 
2. Data: most times especially this period I don't have money to purchase data and most times am online I use free Facebook and I will buy #50 data for WhatsApp only 
3. Phone problem: am using small Android phone and my battery usually fluctuate and also my torch pad 
4. Concentration: if am using my phone for online class I won't be able to concentrate very well because once I have a message from social media I would want to check and my attention may also divert to another things on my phone 
 I suggest if we can be given iPad or tablet with unlimited data and it will be only the application for the class that will be only it and we will be unable to download or receive anything except for the class, with  that  charging it will not be a big problem if the charger fast and the battery is very okay",Yes,3D animation on WhatsApp
