    "This dataset goes into detail about how college students feel having social media? Does it help them? From what the dataset showed, it looked as if many students see the benefits of social media rather than the negatives. Some questions that I would like to ask about this dataset is what social medias seemed to help the most and why? After I get to crunch the numbers, I am eager to see what the percentages are when it comes to how college students view social media."
